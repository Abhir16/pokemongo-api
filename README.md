# Pokemon Go API for Python

This was originally based on
[this API](https://github.com/tejado/pokemongo-api-demo),
you can view this as an advanced
and cleaned up version
based on object-oriented principles.

Additions welcome.

## Demo
`demo.py` includes a demo of the API.

Basically, start out by building a `PogoSession`,
then take it from there.

## Protocol
I also maintain my own version of the
[Pokemon Go Protobuf protocol](https://github.com/rubenvereecken/pokemongo-protocol).
