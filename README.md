# Pokemon Go API for Python

This was originally based on
[this API](https://github.com/tejado/pokemongo-api-demo),
you can view this as an advanced
and cleaned up version
based on object-oriented principles.

Additions welcome.

## Demo
`demo.py` includes a demo of the API.

```
âžœ  python demo.py -a "google" -u "email@gmail.com" -p "thepassword" -l "The Atlantic Ocean"

```

This is achieved with minimal coding effort on the client's part
(extract from `demo.py`):

```
  # ... Blabla define the parser
  if args.auth == 'ptc':
      session = api.createPTCSession(args.username, args.password, args.location)
  elif args.auth == 'google':
      session = api.createGoogleSession(args.username, args.password, args.location)

  if session: # do stuff
      profile = session.getProfile()
      logging.info(profile)
```

## Protocol
I also maintain my own version of the
[Pokemon Go Protobuf protocol](https://github.com/rubenvereecken/pokemongo-protocol).
